1. Enter the program outline (lab3.asm). Run the program to confirm that everything is working correctly: you should see the message “Hello World!”

2. Count the number of occurrences of the letter “l” in the string Hello and print it to the console. Be sure to use the appropriate I/O sequence. 
See pages 8-9 of SPIM S20: A MIPS R2000 Simulator for details.

3. Write code to print all the integer values starting from 0 and less than **AnInt**.

4. Write code to print the integer values of each byte of the array **Input1** while inserting a space
between each pair of integers. Hint: you may want to use the “string” labeled **space**. 

5. Write code to copy the contents of **Input2** to **Copy**.

6. Write code to compute and print the minimum, maximum and integer average of the contents of array **Input1**.

7. Write code to display the first 30 integers (starting from 0) that are divisible by either 7 or 13. Print a comma between all of the integers.

8. Repeat step 7, but this time print only 5 integers per line. This should give you a 6 x 5 matrix of all the numbers. Note: For this part you need to use a 
nested loop. You may also want to take advantage of the “string” labeled lf.
