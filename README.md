## <ins>Course Description</ins>
EC413 is an introduction to the fundamentals and design of computer systems. The starting points are your basic knowledge of logic design and high-level 
language programming. The end points will be your ability to create a working computer from logic gates, to program that computer in assembly language, and 
to be able to evaluate design options. Topics include computer instruction sets, assembly language programming, logic design of arithmetic operations, design 
of sequential logic with registers and buses, CPU design (data path, control, integrating datapath and control, pipelining), performance evaluation, and 
memory systems (including caching and virtual memory). In parallel there is a lab where the focus is on in-depth understanding of selected comp org topics 
including HDL design using Verilog and system design methods.
